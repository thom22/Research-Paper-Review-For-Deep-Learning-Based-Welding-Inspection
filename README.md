# Review On Deep Learning Based Welding Inspection Research Paper

This repository section shows the collection of few research papers on welding inspection based on deep learning. Based on my few month research i have summarized the overall view of deep learning based welding inspection. Enjoy Reading!


## Introduction

Welding quality inspection is a very important task for assuring longevity, safety and reliability in several industrial sectors. In general there are two main types of analysis of the quality of welded beads : destructive and non-destructive testing. Currently, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are widely used since NDT techniques neither cause physical destruction nor affect the functionality of the material during analysis.
